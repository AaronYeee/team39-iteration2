                                For example, a child's presence or absence must be recorded at all times and ask the kinder teachers
                                and your children to make sure they keep washing their hands. This ensures the accuracy of the number of children in attendance and that the correct measures  are being taken.
                                That is why it is important that families sign their child in at the start of the day and out at the end of the day.
                                It also means your attendance is recorded accurately for any Child Care Subsidies you may be receiving.
